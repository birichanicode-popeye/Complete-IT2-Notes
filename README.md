INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET
1.1 Definition of the Internet

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that communicate using standardized protocols known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). These protocols allow billions of devices worldwide to exchange data reliably and efficiently. Through the internet, users can communicate, share information, transfer data, and access a wide range of online services such as websites, email, and cloud platforms.

In simple terms, the internet enables computers, smartphones, and other digital devices to communicate with one another over long distances.

1.2 Brief History of the Internet

The development of the internet began in the 1960s with the creation of ARPANET by the United States Department of Defense. The goal was to establish a reliable communication network that could withstand disruptions. In the 1980s, the standardization of TCP/IP made it possible for different networks to interconnect, forming the foundation of the modern internet.

In the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web (WWW), which revolutionized how information is accessed by using web pages and hyperlinks. From the 2000s to the present, the internet has expanded rapidly, supporting social media, cloud computing, e-learning platforms, mobile internet, and advanced scientific collaboration.

1.3 Importance of the Internet

The internet plays a critical role in modern society by supporting education, research, and global communication. It enables students and researchers to access digital libraries, online journals, and academic databases. Communication services such as email, instant messaging, and video conferencing allow real-time interaction across the world.

The internet also supports e-commerce, online banking, cloud storage, and collaborative tools. For science students, it is particularly important as it provides access to scientific publications, bioinformatics tools, virtual laboratories, and remote learning platforms.

1.4 Internet vs World Wide Web (WWW)

The internet refers to the physical and logical infrastructure that connects devices globally, including cables, routers, servers, and communication protocols. The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is a service that operates on the internet and consists of interconnected web pages accessed using browsers through HTTP or HTTPS.

While the internet supports many services such as email, file transfer, and streaming, the World Wide Web is only one of these services.

1.5 Internet Services

The internet provides a wide range of services that support communication and information sharing. These include Electronic Mail (Email) for sending and receiving messages, the World Wide Web for accessing web content, File Transfer services such as FTP and cloud storage, online communication tools like VoIP and chat applications, and streaming services for audio and video content.

1.6 How the Internet Works (Basic Concept)

When a user enters a website address or URL into a browser, the browser sends a request to a remote server hosting the website. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name into an IP address that identifies the server. Data is then transmitted between the user’s device and the server using TCP/IP protocols. The server processes the request and responds by sending the requested web content back to the browser.

1.7 Internet Protocols

Internet protocols are standardized rules that govern how data is transmitted and received across networks. HTTP and HTTPS are used for web communication, while TCP/IP forms the core framework of internet data exchange. FTP is used for file transfer, SMTP for sending email, POP3 and IMAP for receiving email, and DNS for converting domain names into IP addresses.

Reference:
https://www.ibm.com/topics/network-protocols

1.8 IP Addresses and Domain Names

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network. IPv4 addresses are written in dotted decimal form, such as 192.168.1.1, while IPv6 addresses use a hexadecimal format, such as 2001:db8::1.

A domain name is a human-readable name that maps to an IP address, making it easier for users to access websites. For example, www.jkuat.ac.ke
 represents a domain name linked to a specific server.

1.9 Advantages of the Internet

The internet offers fast and efficient communication, access to vast amounts of global information, and support for remote learning and research collaboration. It enables scientists and students to share data, publish findings, and work together across geographical boundaries. Additionally, it provides cost-effective methods for data storage and dissemination.

1.10 Challenges and Risks of the Internet

Despite its benefits, the internet presents several challenges, including cybersecurity threats such as hacking and malware, data privacy concerns, and the spread of misinformation. Over-dependence on the internet can also affect productivity and social interaction if not managed responsibly.

1. Introduction to Networking

Definition of a Network:
A network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, printers, etc.) that communicate with each other to share resources (files, internet, printers) and information.

Purpose of Networking:

Enables communication between devices.

Facilitates resource sharing (e.g., printers, storage).

Supports centralized data management.

Allows remote access to services.
