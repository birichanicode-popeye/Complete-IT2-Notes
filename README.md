INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET
1.1 Definition of the Internet

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that communicate using standardized protocols known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). These protocols allow billions of devices worldwide to exchange data reliably and efficiently. Through the internet, users can communicate, share information, transfer data, and access a wide range of online services such as websites, email, and cloud platforms.

In simple terms, the internet enables computers, smartphones, and other digital devices to communicate with one another over long distances.

1.2 Brief History of the Internet

The development of the internet began in the 1960s with the creation of ARPANET by the United States Department of Defense. The goal was to establish a reliable communication network that could withstand disruptions. In the 1980s, the standardization of TCP/IP made it possible for different networks to interconnect, forming the foundation of the modern internet.

In the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web (WWW), which revolutionized how information is accessed by using web pages and hyperlinks. From the 2000s to the present, the internet has expanded rapidly, supporting social media, cloud computing, e-learning platforms, mobile internet, and advanced scientific collaboration.

1.3 Importance of the Internet

The internet plays a critical role in modern society by supporting education, research, and global communication. It enables students and researchers to access digital libraries, online journals, and academic databases. Communication services such as email, instant messaging, and video conferencing allow real-time interaction across the world.

The internet also supports e-commerce, online banking, cloud storage, and collaborative tools. For science students, it is particularly important as it provides access to scientific publications, bioinformatics tools, virtual laboratories, and remote learning platforms.

1.4 Internet vs World Wide Web (WWW)

The internet refers to the physical and logical infrastructure that connects devices globally, including cables, routers, servers, and communication protocols. The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is a service that operates on the internet and consists of interconnected web pages accessed using browsers through HTTP or HTTPS.

While the internet supports many services such as email, file transfer, and streaming, the World Wide Web is only one of these services.

Reference:
https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html

1.5 Internet Services

The internet provides a wide range of services that support communication and information sharing. These include Electronic Mail (Email) for sending and receiving messages, the World Wide Web for accessing web content, File Transfer services such as FTP and cloud storage, online communication tools like VoIP and chat applications, and streaming services for audio and video content.

Reference:
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/

1.6 How the Internet Works (Basic Concept)

When a user enters a website address or URL into a browser, the browser sends a request to a remote server hosting the website. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name into an IP address that identifies the server. Data is then transmitted between the user’s device and the server using TCP/IP protocols. The server processes the request and responds by sending the requested web content back to the browser.

Reference:
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/

1.7 Internet Protocols

Internet protocols are standardized rules that govern how data is transmitted and received across networks. HTTP and HTTPS are used for web communication, while TCP/IP forms the core framework of internet data exchange. FTP is used for file transfer, SMTP for sending email, POP3 and IMAP for receiving email, and DNS for converting domain names into IP addresses.

Reference:
https://www.ibm.com/topics/network-protocols

1.8 IP Addresses and Domain Names

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network. IPv4 addresses are written in dotted decimal form, such as 192.168.1.1, while IPv6 addresses use a hexadecimal format, such as 2001:db8::1.

A domain name is a human-readable name that maps to an IP address, making it easier for users to access websites. For example, www.jkuat.ac.ke
 represents a domain name linked to a specific server.

Reference:
https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-is-an-ip-address-2019-03-04-en

1.9 Advantages of the Internet

The internet offers fast and efficient communication, access to vast amounts of global information, and support for remote learning and research collaboration. It enables scientists and students to share data, publish findings, and work together across geographical boundaries. Additionally, it provides cost-effective methods for data storage and dissemination.

1.10 Challenges and Risks of the Internet

Despite its benefits, the internet presents several challenges, including cybersecurity threats such as hacking and malware, data privacy concerns, and the spread of misinformation. Over-dependence on the internet can also affect productivity and social interaction if not managed responsibly.

Absolutely! Let’s create a comprehensive lecture-style note for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), formatted for Markdown, covering definition, history, syntax, selectors, properties, box model, layout techniques, responsive design, animations, best practices, and references.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – Complete Notes
1. Definition

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of an HTML document. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of web pages. CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation (styling).

Reference: MDN CSS Introduction

2. History

1994: CSS1 introduced by W3C, basic text styling and positioning.

1996: CSS2 added positioning, media types, and z-index.

1998: CSS2.1 improved CSS2 with bug fixes and better browser support.

2011: CSS3 modularized features like animations, transitions, flexbox, and media queries.

Reference: CSS History

3. CSS Syntax
selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

Explanation:

Selector: Targets HTML elements (e.g., p, .class, #id)

Property: CSS attribute to style (e.g., color, font-size)

Value: The value assigned to the property (e.g., red, 16px)

Example:

p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}

4. Types of CSS

Inline CSS – added directly in HTML elements using the style attribute.

<p style="color:red;">Hello</p>


Internal CSS – placed in the <style> tag inside <head>.

<style>
    body {background-color: lightgrey;}
</style>


External CSS – stored in a separate .css file and linked using <link>.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

5. Selectors
5.1 Basic Selectors

element → targets all elements of a type (p {})

.class → targets elements with a specific class (.highlight {})

#id → targets an element with a specific ID (#header {})

5.2 Combinators

Descendant: div p {}

Child: div > p {}

Adjacent sibling: h1 + p {}

General sibling: h1 ~ p {}

5.3 Pseudo-classes

:hover – style when mouse hovers

:first-child – first child element

:nth-child(n) – nth child element

5.4 Pseudo-elements

::before – insert content before element

::after – insert content after element

Reference: CSS Selectors

6. CSS Properties
6.1 Text & Font

color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-align, line-height

6.2 Background & Borders

background-color, background-image, border, border-radius

6.3 Spacing

margin, padding

6.4 Display & Visibility

display (block, inline, inline-block, none)

visibility (visible, hidden)

6.5 Positioning

position (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)

top, right, bottom, left, z-index

7. The Box Model

All HTML elements are boxes, consisting of:

Content – text or media

Padding – space between content and border

Border – edge around padding

Margin – space outside the border

div {
    width: 200px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 5px solid black;
    margin: 20px;
}


Reference: CSS Box Model

8. Layout Techniques
8.1 Flexbox

One-dimensional layout (row or column)

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

8.2 Grid

Two-dimensional layout (rows and columns)

.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
    gap: 10px;
}

8.3 Float & Clear

Older layout method, replaced by Flexbox/Grid

9. Responsive Web Design

Adjusts layout based on screen size or device.

Media Queries Example:

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {background-color: lightblue;}
}


Reference: Responsive Design Guide

10. CSS Animations & Transitions
10.1 Transition

Smoothly changes property values

button {
    transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
button:hover {
    background-color: red;
}

10.2 Animation

Keyframes define motion

@keyframes slide {
    from {margin-left: 0;}
    to {margin-left: 100px;}
}
div {animation: slide 2s infinite;}


Reference: CSS Animations

11. Best Practices

Use external CSS for multi-page websites.

Keep CSS organized (group related styles).

Use classes instead of IDs for reusable styles.

Avoid inline styles; maintain separation of content and presentation.

Use semantic class names (.nav-bar, .footer).

Minify CSS for production.

}

Explanation:

Selector: Targets HTML elements (e.g., p, .class, #id)

Property: CSS attribute to style (e.g., color, font-size)

Value: The value assigned to the property (e.g., red, 16px)

Example:

p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}

4. Types of CSS

<p style="color:red;">Hello</p>


Internal CSS – placed in the <style> tag inside <head>.

<style>
    body {background-color: lightgrey;}
</style>


External CSS – stored in a separate .css file and linked using <link>.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

5. Selectors

Descendant: div p {}

Child: div > p {}

Adjacent sibling: h1 + p {}

General sibling: h1 ~ p {}

5.3 Pseudo-classes

:hover – style when mouse hovers

:first-child – first child element

:nth-child(n) – nth child element

// Single-line comment
/* Multi-line comment */

let name = "John"; // variable declaration
const PI = 3.14;   // constant
var age = 25;      // older declaration style

console.log("Hello World!"); // prints to console

4. Variables

var: Function-scoped, older syntax.

let: Block-scoped, preferred for reassignable variables.

const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned (immutable reference).

let username = "Alice";
const MAX_USERS = 100;


Reference: Variables in JavaScript

5. Data Types

Primitive Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint

Reference Types: object, array, function

let fruits = ["Apple","Banana"];
fruits.push("Orange"); // add
fruits.pop();          // remove

10.2 Objects
let user = {name: "John", age: 30};
console.log(user.name); // Access property
user.email = "john@example.com"; // Add property

11. DOM Manipulation

Document Object Model (DOM): Interface representing HTML elements as objects.

// Select element
const heading = document.getElementById("title");
heading.textContent = "Welcome";

// Create element
const p = document.createElement("p");
